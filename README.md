# HP-EliteBook 850 G5 Hackintosh

A HP EliteBook 850 G5 Hackintosh running Mojave 10.14.6.

## Description

I have already two Hackintoshes :

* A desktop [Hackintosh](https://github.com/kinoute/Hack-Z370-HD3P-i5-8400) at home with a i5-8400 and a Gigabyte Z370-HD3P ;
* A Dell Latitude E6430 [Hackintosh](https://github.com/kinoute/Hack-Dell-Latitude-E6430) I was given at work.

I had the change to put my hands on a nice HP EliteBook 850 G5 Laptop and couldn't resist, again, to install macOS on it.

_WORK IN PROGRESS.._
